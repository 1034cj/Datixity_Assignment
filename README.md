# Datixity_Assignment

Datixity is working on analyzing customer purchasing behaviour. Using the provided dataset, perform the following tasks:

1) Build a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will spend above or below the average transaction value (Total column).
2) Use appropriate evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score) to assess the model's performance.
3) Provide a brief report on the most important features (e.g., Product line, Branch, Customer type, etc.) that influence customer spending behaviour.
4) Suggest strategies for increasing customer transaction amounts based on your findings.

Solution (Reference):

Model:

    Split the dataset into training and test sets, and use logistic regression or decision tree model to classify whether a customerâ€™s transaction is above or below the average value.
    Include features such as Product line, Quantity, Branch, Payment method, and Customer type.

Evaluation Metrics:

    Report the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Feature Importance:

    Features like Product line, Customer type (Member/Normal), and City can have significant impacts on customer spending.
